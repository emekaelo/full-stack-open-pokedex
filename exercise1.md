Some popular tools for linting, testing, and building in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment for a Python software project are;

Linting:
Flake8: A tool that combines the functionality of PyFlakes, pycodestyle (formerly pep8), and Ned Batchelder's McCabe script.
Pylint: A code analysis tool that checks for errors, enforces code standards, and looks for code smells.

Testing:
pytest: A powerful, flexible, and extensible testing framework for Python.
coverage: A tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs.
Selenium: A web browser automation tool used for end-to-end testing of web applications.

Continuous Integration (CI):
CircleCI: A CI/CD platform that helps build, test, and deploy software projects.
Travis CI: A CI service that integrates with GitHub and other version control systems.
GitLab CI/CD: A built-in CI/CD solution that is part of the GitLab platform.

When deciding between a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment, the things to consider includes:

- Application's security and compliance requirements
- The maturity and stability of your infrastructure needs
- The team's expertise and resources for managing a self-hosted environment
- The scalability requirements of your application
- Budget and cost optimization goals


  In many cases, a hybrid approach that leverages both self-hosted and cloud-based resources can be an optimal solution, allowing you to benefit from the advantages of both environments.
